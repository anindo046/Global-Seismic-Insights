# About Me: Anindo Paul Sourav
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Anindo Paul Sourav, a geology student at Barishal University, passionate about combining data science with environmental research. This repository showcases my work and learning journey, particularly in the EDGE program.

## EDGE Program
The EDGE (Exploring Data and Geoscience Expertise) program at Barishal University has been a transformative experience, blending advanced data science techniques with practical applications in geology. Through this program, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in earthquake data analysis, machine learning, and spatial data science.

### The courses in this program have expanded my skills in:

Data cleaning and exploration
Machine learning for real-world applications
Geospatial data analysis using Python and GIS
Statistical analysis and visualization
I am excited to continue exploring how data science can drive impactful solutions for environmental and geological challenges.
