# 🌍 Global Seismic Insights  

**Analyzing global earthquake trends using Python**  

---

## 📊 Objective  
To explore earthquake data and uncover patterns in magnitude, location, and frequency.  

---

## 🔬 Methods  
1. Cleaned and processed the dataset using Pandas.  
2. Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
3. Mapped earthquake locations with Geopandas.
